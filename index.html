                    <p>
                        As a musician and developer, I understand the creative industry from the inside out.<br />
                        I help artists, brands, and businesses bridge the gap between their vision and the digital
                        world.<br />
                        I don't just write code; I build platforms that tell a story.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I focus on clean architecture, intuitive UX, and creative flair,<br />
                        ensuring your digital presence hits all the right notes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Beyond the Screen:</strong><br /><br>
                        I specialize in building responsive, high-performance web applications that don't sacrifice
                        style for speed.
                        Whether you need a bespoke portfolio, a complex e-commerce solution, or a custom interactive
                        experience,
                        I bring a developer's precision and an artist's intuition to every project.
                    </p>

    Music has been a part of my life since I was six years old. Starting my training with Sri Raghavendra Upadhyaya, I later advanced my skills under the guidance of Sri Gajanana Hebbar and Smt. Sushma.<br>
    <br>
    My journey has been marked by numerous accolades at the state level and the incredible experience of competing on the big stage at Swara Saagara 2025.

    <h1>CODING JOURNEY</h1>
    <p>
        My coding journey began in 2020 when I took my first steps into the world of programming. Over the years, I've honed my skills in various programming languages and frameworks, allowing me to create dynamic and responsive web applications.<br>
        <br>
        From building simple websites to developing complex applications, my passion for coding has driven me to continuously learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.
